1- Generate initial population of size N.  ---------------------->READY
2-Evaluate each solutionsâ€™ fitness/goodness. ---------------------->READY
3-Select 2 solutions as parents without repetition. ---------------------->READY 
4-Do Crossover, Mutation and Inversion and create 2 offsprings. ----------------------> CASI READY
    evaluate the fitness of offspring.

If offspring are better than the worst solutions then replace the worst individuals with the offspring such that population size remains constant.
Check for convergence criteria.
If convergence criteria are met, then terminate the program else continue with step 3
